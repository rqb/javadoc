Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can "just run".

Spring Boot使创建独立的、生产级的、基于Spring的应用程序变得容易，您可以只负责运行。

We take an opinionated view of the Spring platform and third-party libraries so you can get started with minimum fuss. Most Spring Boot applications need very little Spring configuration.

我们对Spring平台和第三方类库有一个独到的观点，这样你就可以开始用最少的麻烦了。大多数Spring Boot应用程序只需要很少的Spring配置。

## 特性

- Create stand-alone Spring applications
- Embed Tomcat, Jetty or Undertow directly (no need to deploy WAR files)
- Provide opinionated 'starter' dependencies to simplify your build configuration
- Automatically configure Spring and 3rd party libraries whenever possible
- Provide production-ready features such as metrics, health checks and externalized configuration
- Absolutely no code generation and no requirement for XML configuration
